**Eastendmonitor**

This is my sneaker project, aimed at making money, which can monitor available sizes for each product on the eastendshop.com website.

**Features**

Created a simple interface for launching the bot.
Added various commands for interacting with the bot on Discord.
Developed an asynchronous function for fetching data from a third-party API.
Supports slash commands for enhanced interaction.

**Installation**

To use this bot, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the main.exe file located in the dist folder.
3. Follow the instructions in the interface.

**Usage**

Once the bot is running and the bot's working data is entered correctly, you can use the following commands:

/url - to add a link for monitoring (you can add an unlimited number of links)

/urls - to show the list of URLs currently being monitored

/urls_clear - to clear the list of URLs (the bot will continue to work, and you can start adding new URLs from scratch).

Please note that you can only monitor products from the eastendshop.com website.
